//Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted Linked LIst. How would you solve this problem if temporary buffer wasnt allowed ?

//Return kth to last: Implement an algo, to find kth from last element of a singly LL

//Delete middle node: Implement an algo to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node, not necessarily in thr exact middle)
// of a Single LL, given only access to the node, nothing is returned

// Partition: Write code to partition the LL around value X, such that all nodes less than X ome before all nodes greater than or equal to X.
// If X is contained within the list, the calues of X only need to be after the elements less than X. The partition element X can appear anywhere in the 'right partition'
// It doesnt need to appear between left and right partitions.
// e.g. : 3, 5,8, 5, 10, 2, 1 - input
// 3,1,2,10,5,5,8 - output 

// Sum Lists : You have 2 numbers represented by a LL, where each node contains a single digit.
// The digits are stored in reverse order, such that 1's digit is at the head  of the list. Write a function that adds the 2 numbers, 
// and returns teh sum as linked list.

// palindrome: Implement a function to see if a LL is a palindrome

// intersection: Given 2 Singly LL, determine if the 2 intersect. Return the intersecting node.
// Note that the intersection is based on reference, not value. i.e. if the kth node of the first LL is the exact same node by reference as the jth node of the 2nd LL. then they are intersecting.

// Loop detection: Given a circular LL, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
